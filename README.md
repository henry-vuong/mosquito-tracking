# mosquito-tracking

West Nile Virus (WNV) is a viral illness largely spread by mosquitoes. The disease is transmitted to a person when an infected mosquito bites them.

The city of Chicago, Illinois has been keeping track of mosquito populations and WNV prevalence using a series of traps that they place around the city. They are then able to study the captured specimens and monitor the state of WNV spread in the city.

The data is  mosquito tracking data from 2008 to 2019.

In these Notebooks, I will perform basic(part 1) and advanced (part 2) EDA and data wrangling to get familiar with the dataset from the city of Chicago.
